The 21st Century runs on statistical analysis focussing mainly on social causes. This motivates
us to go for healthcare data as “Analysis in Healthcare” will definitely contribute for Social Good.
From the healthcare community article, we found that there is an increase in the national
consumption of heroin and prescription painkillers.

A class of controlled pain-management drugs that contain natural/synthetic chemicals based on
morphine which is the active component of opium. These drugs are often called as opioids
which effectively mimic pain-relieving chemicals that the body produces naturally. We wish to
mitigate the problem of Drug Overdoses by uncovering trends in prescription data, overdose
deaths data with respect to different regions.

We will be using “Causes of Death by Opioid Consumption” dataset to answer the following
problem by considering educational, demographics and geographical factors:
<ol>
  <li>Identifying the areas affected by Opioid Consumption?</li>
  <li>To predict what chemicals when used in significant quantities creates an opioid drug?</li>
  <li>To use predictive analysis to predict the likelihood that a given doctor is a significant
  prescriber of opiates. The motive behind this is that a systematic way of identifying
  sources may reveal trends in particular practices, fields, or regions of the country that
  can be used to combat this problem effectively.</li>
  <li>To predict instances of drug overdoses and prevent them from occurring?</li>
</ol>
